PPE files have the following form:

HEADER
VARIABLE_TABLE
CODE_SIZE
CODE


Header:
PCBoard Programming Language Executable  <VER>\x0D\x0A\x1A

<VER> is #.## for example "3.30" or "3.40"


VARIABLE_TABLE

A list of entries in the form:

Header (encrypted):

index           u16
dims            u8
vector_size     u16
matrix_size     u16
cube_size       u16
var_type        u8
flags           u8

- flags: if bit 0 is set then the variable won't be reinitialized.
if it's 1 then the variable will be reinitalized (locals in a function/procedure)

Content:

For type string:

size           u16
string         u8[size] (encrypted)

Otherwise:
garbage        u16 (VTABLE from C class - get's skipped by PCBoard, pure garbage)
var_type       u16 - should be u8, same as var_type from above basically
content        u64 - Constant expression that should be 

CODE_SIZE

u16 to define the code block size in bytes.
If the block length differs from code_size then the block was compressed using RLE encoding.

CODE

u16 array of statements
