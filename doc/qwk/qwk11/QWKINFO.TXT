                 By Mark May - Mythical Kingdom Software

        While writing a QWK utility, I found that there was no
        one place where all the necessary info on the QWK format
        was available.  Thru messages in several network echo
        conferences (Thanks to Tim Farley, Mark Goodwin, Randy
        Blackmond, Mark Herring, Patrick Lee, Greg Hewgill, and
        others), I gradually collected the information enclosed
        in this archive.

        To save others the time collecting this information, I've
        put together this set of files by editing the information
        from the various sources so that it is conveniently
        available.

        Tim Farley is working on a more rigorous specification and
        I'm sure all of us would appreciate any help you can give
        him in this.   If you find any errors or additional
        information, I'd also appreciate hearing about it so that
        I can further update this set of files.
